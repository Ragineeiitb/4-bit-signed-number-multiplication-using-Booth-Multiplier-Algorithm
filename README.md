Booth's Multiplication Algorithm is a commonly used algorithm for multiplication of two signed numbers 
To implement this algorithm "valid bit" is being generated which becomes high when valid result will obtained.
The Booth Multiplier Algorithm implemented in this format can be implemented on FPGA devices.
Number of clock cycles taken to produce the output depends on the counter value. 
The number of bits of the incoming operands and output product can also be increased to perform mulitplication with larger signed numbers.
